# United States Web Design System

The [United States Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) includes a library of open source UI components and a visual style guide for U.S. federal government websites.

This repository is a port of the design system itself, the goal of this project is to make USWDS components viable and easy to use inside of React projects, without the excess bloat and common uncustomizable mess most suffer with while using USWDS.

We want to make USWD components as simple as <Banner title="An official website of the United States government" information={false} />

This project is a work-in-progress, we do not recommend using it until a stable version is released.
